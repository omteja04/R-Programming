# Description: Write a R program to create three vectors a,b,c with 3 integers. Combine the three vectors to become a 3Ã—3 matrix where each column represents a vector. Print the content of the matrix.



a <- c(1, 2, 3)
b <- c(4, 5, 6)
c <- c(7, 8, 9)
m <- cbind(a, b, c)
print("Content of the said matrix:")
print(m)

# Combining Vectors into a Matrix:
# cbind(a, b, c) combines the vectors a, b, and c column-wise to create a matrix m. 
# Each vector becomes a column in the matrix.
