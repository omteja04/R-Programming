# Description: Write a R program to create a sequence of numbers from 20 to 50 and find the mean of numbers from 20 to 60 and sum of numbers from 51 to 91.

print("Sequence of numbers from 20 to 50:")
print(seq(20, 50))
print("Mean of numbers from 20 to 60:")
print(mean(20:60))
print("Sum of numbers from 51 to 91:")
print(sum(51:91))

# Sequence Generation (seq()):
# The seq() function generates sequences of numbers in R. It takes arguments for the starting value, ending value, and optional increment (or decrement) value to generate the sequence.

# Mean Calculation (mean()):
# The mean() function computes the arithmetic mean (average) of a numeric vector in R. It sums up all the values and divides by the total number of values.

# Summation (sum()):
# The sum() function calculates the sum of all the elements in a numeric vector. It adds up all the values in the specified range.
