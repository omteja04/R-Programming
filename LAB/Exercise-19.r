# Description: Write a R program to multiply two vectors of integers type and length 3.

# Create two vectors of integers with length 3
vector1 <- c(2, 4, 6)
vector2 <- c(3, 5, 7)

# Multiply the two vectors element-wise
result_vector <- vector1 * vector2

# Print the original vectors and the result
cat("Vector 1: ", vector1, "\n")
cat("Vector 2: ", vector2, "\n")
cat("Result: ", result_vector, "\n")
